## Introduction

The Course Subscription Application allows learners to view available courses and subscribe to them. This boilerplate provides the essential components to help you implement features such as fetching course lists, subscribing to courses, and displaying subscribed courses.

> The goal is to have workable simple version of application that involves ServiceNow in some way. We do not expect you to understand whole ServiceNow platform in couple of days. 

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **ServiceNow Personal Developer Instance (PDI)**
    - Sign up at [developer.servicenow.com](https://developer.servicenow.com/) if you don't have one.
- **ServiceNow Studio Access**
    - You will use Studio to import and manage the application.
- **Git and Remote Repository**
    - The repository is public; you should be able to clone it to your local machine and push it to the desired remote repository of your choice.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the application in your ServiceNow instance.

### 1. Set Up Your ServiceNow Developer Instance

 **Sign Up for a PDI**

- Visit [developer.servicenow.com](https://developer.servicenow.com/) and create an account.
- Request a Personal Developer Instance (PDI) and follow the instructions to activate it.

 **Access Your PDI**

- Once your instance is ready, log in using the credentials provided.

### 2. Clone the Application

 **Obtain the Repository URL**

- Get the HTTPS URL of this repository hosting the application.
- Clone it to your local machine.
- Create a remote repository on your desired provider (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
- Change the remote to point to your new repository, then push the code to it.

 **Create Git Credentials in ServiceNow**

- In your PDI, navigate to **Connections & Credentials > Credentials**.
- Click **New** and select **Credential**.
- Select **Basic Auth Credentials**.
- Fill in the following:

    - **Name**: *Git Source Control Credential*
    - **Username**: *Your username*
    - **Password**: *Your app password or account password*
- Save the credential.

**Import the Application via Studio**
- Use the application navigator to go to **All > Studio**.
- You can now import the application that you pushed to your remote repository. Follow the guide: [Import App into the PDI](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/learn/learning-plans/quebec/new_to_servicenow/app_store_learnv2_devenvironment_quebec_importing_an_application_from_source_control).

**Verify the Import**
- Once the import is complete, you should see the application files in Studio.
- Ensure there are no errors or conflicts.

## Application Overview

### Data Model

The application consists of three main tables:

## Navigating the Application

### Accessing the Application

**Open the Application Navigator**:

- In your ServiceNow instance, use the filter navigator on the left. Click the **"All"** menu item on the top navigation bar to open the Application Navigator.
- You should find the **"CourseHub"** application menu.
- **Courses** and **Learners** are listed under **"CourseHub"**.

**Explore the Tables, Lists, and Forms**

- Click on **"Course"** or **"Learners"**.
- Create a few relevant records using the standard UI.

**Default REST API**

- All the existing tables have REST API enabled.
- You can check the [Table API](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference/api/quebec/rest/c_TableAPI).
- You can also explore using the REST API Explorer, which you can navigate to using the Application Navigator: **System Web Services > REST API Explorer**.

## Next Steps

Now that you have the application set up, you can start implementing the required features. You have two options for building the web front-end user interface (UI):

**Develop UI within ServiceNow**: Utilize NOW platform built-in tools to create custom UIs directly inside your ServiceNow instance. This includes using tools like UI Builder or UI Pages to design and implement your interface.

**Build UI externally**: Create the front end using any external web development frameworks or libraries of your choice, such as React, Angular, or Vue.js. You can then integrate your UI with the ServiceNow backend via REST APIs. You can explore about ServiceNow [REST API](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=c_RESTAPI.html&version=latest). For simplicity, we recommend using Table API, as pointed above.

If you choose to develop the UI within ServiceNow, the following resources may be helpful:

- [UI Builder](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=ui-builder-overview.html&version=latest)
- [UI Pages](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=r_UIPages.html&version=latest)

> Follow the assignment instructions provided, focus on implementing features that you can.
